# SQL-Database-Project
Create a MySQL database, import data from a CSV file, and perform basic data analysis using SQL queries.
This project is a hands-on exploration of creating a MySQL database, importing data from a CSV file, and performing basic data analysis using SQL queries. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in database management and SQL skills.

## Features
- **Database Creation:** Utilized MySQL to create a database for storing and analyzing a sample dataset.
- **Table Structure:** Designed a table structure based on the columns present in the provided CSV file.
- **Data Import:** Implemented the import of data from a CSV file into the MySQL database.
- **Data Analysis:** Utilized SQL queries to perform basic data analysis on the imported dataset. Example queries include finding the average age and displaying records from the dataset.

## Project Structure
- `scripts/`: Contains SQL scripts for database creation, table definition, and data import.
- `data/`: Includes the sample CSV dataset used in the project.
- `README.md`: Documentation providing an overview of the project, instructions for setting up the database, and examples of SQL queries for data analysis.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improvements or new features, feel free to submit a pull request.

## Way Forward
Web Application: Extend the project by creating a simple web application using a framework like Flask or Django in Python. This application can connect to the MySQL database and dynamically display results from data analysis queries.
